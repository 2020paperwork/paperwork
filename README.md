# SHVE
This repository holds the implementation of Symmetric-key Hidden Vector Encryption (SHVE) Scheme.

As a new cryptographic primitive, SHVE is the first HVE scheme only relies on the symmetric-key building block. It is much faster than its pairing-based antecedents. This work is a part of our ACM CCS'18 paper[1].
